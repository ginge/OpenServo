# *** modules2 currently has 'experimental' status.  Testing is encouraged but.
# for greatest stability use the modules file. ***
#
# This file describes the layout of virtual directory structures
# within the repository.
#
# The layout is similar to a Windows .ini file.  For example:
#
# [foo]
# dir1/dir2/dir3 = realdir1/realdir2
# dir1/dir3 = !realdir1/realdir3 (^*js$|^*cpp$)
#
# [bar]
# / = realdir4
# dir_to_delete =
# foo = foo
#
# The special character '!' stops recursion to directories below the one specified (-l option).
# The special character '+' stops parsing of that line, so that you can avoid infinte loops.
#
# Items in (...) are an extended regular expression applied to the filenames.  All files which do not.
# match are ignored.
