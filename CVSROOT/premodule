# The "premodule" file is run before cvs module is processed.
# The filter on the right is invoked with the repository name, 
# the name of the command that has been executed, and the module name.
# A non-zero return value with abort the command with an error.
#
# The first entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
# against the directory that the change is being committed to, relative
# to the $CVSROOT.  For the first match that is found, then the remainder
# of the line is the name of the filter to run.
#
# If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions in this
# file, the "DEFAULT" line is used, if it is specified.
#
# If the name "ALL" appears as a regular expression it is always used
# in addition to the first matching regex or "DEFAULT".
